# Todos and Improvements

Since this is a minimal app for demo purposes, some nice improvements and features were left out. Here's a list of potential code and UI/UX improvements:

- [ ] Add e2e tests around the Home container
- [ ] add `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to images (this one was left out since we dont't have large images that scale drastically)
- [ ] Call /configuration api on app initialization to fetch differnt image sizes and images path
- [ ] Add placeholder elements in the list while the app is fetching the api
- [ ] Add more support to older browsers and include pollyfills
- [ ] Report api errors to an error tracking tool like Sentry.io
- [ ] Have a nicer logo :sweat_smile: and import it as SVG
- [ ] Add user event tracking through something like GTM or Segment and capture with Google Analytics
- [ ] Setup commit linting for a consistent git history
